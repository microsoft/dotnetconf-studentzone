## Overview

In this session, we will discuss .NET's way to run C# and XAML code on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. We'll quickly explain what [.NET MAUI](github.com/dotnet/maui) is, how a project is typically structured, and get you started with our sample workshop so you can learn more at your own pace!

| **Goal**              | *At the end of the workshop, you'll be able to run your .NET MAUI app on different platforms and have a better understanding of how the framework works!*                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What will you learn**       | *You'll get started writing .NET MAUI code and deploying your app to desktop and mobile platforms*                                        |
| **What you'll need**          | *See #Prerequisites section* |
