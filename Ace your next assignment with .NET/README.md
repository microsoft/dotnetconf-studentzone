# Ace your next assugnment with .NET

This session will require Viasual Studio, therefore will be running only on Windows

## what do you need

 * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
 * [.NET SDK 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

## How to get started

 * open the solution file `Ace your next assignment with .NET.sln`
 * perform a ful build (common shortcut will be `CTRL+SHIFT+B` )
 * turn on *Live Unit Testing* using the menu `Test->live Unit Testing Window`
 * in the `Live Unit Testing` wundow hit the start (play) button, on first run will ask for setup
  * pick a directory to store the workspace 
  * click on `Finish`

    Now the `Live Unit Testing` will go on building the solution and discovering the test cases. Once is all done you can see that there are few tests defined and not working.

## Test implementation
Look for `README.ms` files in the folder `SignalProcessing` and `Resume-backend`, they describe the requirements that will help you implementing the tests that will drive your design process. Keep an eye for any hint from `Visual Studio`! Levergage quick fixes by clicking on icons or jsut use `CRTL+.` (that is the default setting in the IDE) to access refactoring tools, will be using a lot of those to help us create methods, classes, and update signatures.
