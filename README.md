## What is the .NET Conf Student Zone?
As part of [.NET Conf this year](https://www.dotnetconf.net/), we are hosting a .NET Student Zone on Monday, November 7! This is a livestreamed event where experts will introduce you to .NET and and build awesome, follow-along projects. You will walk away with a project portfolio on your very own portfolio website. In total the event will be 4+ hours of content.

## Join the challenge to win SWAG üéÅüéâ
[Join the .NET Conf Student Zone Microsoft Learn, Cloud Skills Challenge and Win Swag](http://aka.ms/dotnetstudententry )
After enjoying the .NET Conf Student Zone, you will be ready to complete the .NET Conf Student Zone Cloud Skills Challenge. The challenge is open to all students who registered for .NET Conf on November 7 until November 29th and three lucky winners will get a .NET Conf SWAG bag!

## Using this repo and development container

### GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the **Open with Codespaces** option.
1. Select **+ New codespace** at the bottom on the pane.

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "Python" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.   

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

3. **Rebuild or update your container**

   You may want to make changes to your container, such as installing a different version of a software or forwarding a new port. You'll rebuild your container for your changes to take effect. 

   **Open browser automatically:** As an example change, let's update the `portsAttributes` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to open a browser when our port is automatically forwarded.
   
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Modify the `"onAutoForward"` attribute in your `portsAttributes` from `"notify"` to `"openBrowser"`.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.
