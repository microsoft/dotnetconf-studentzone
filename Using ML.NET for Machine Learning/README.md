# Using ML.NET for Machine Learning
## Build a regression model to estimate water consumption

In this session, you will use ML.NET framework and .NET Interactive to estimate water consumption and refill (measured in grams) starting from historical data of accelerometer's aggregated measures. 

## What do you need

### Run the ML notebook locally  
 * [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
 * [.NET SDK 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
 * [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) (Formerly known as .NET Interactive)

### Run the ML notebook on the cloud
 * A Github account enabled to [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) 

## How to get started

### In local environment
 * Check that you have all the prerequisite described above
 * Open the interactive notebook file `WaterConsumptionMLproject.ipynb` in Visual Studio Code.
 * Run the notebook using the .NET interactive kernel

### On Github Codespaces
 * Create a new codespaces starting from main branch, by clicking on the green `Code<>` button in the repository home page.
